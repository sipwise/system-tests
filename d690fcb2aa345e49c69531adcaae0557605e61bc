But for CARRIER I think this will be problematic as AFAIR the admins can change the host names at will and things are supposed to keep working? :/ It will work for our test carrier but not for random systems, but if they change the config this will not work for random systems anyway, so I guess this is not a general purpose checker (at least right now).",

We for sure will need to adopt them for production usage, as ALE want to have them, they are fast and reliable. But for production I would create \"LIVE\u003dtrue\" mode where hosts will be shoosen from network.yml and some tests are skipped... \n\n\nWhat do you think?",
