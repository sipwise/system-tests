      "message": "I thought about that, also because we might be pulling asterisk into nodes that might not really need them. But we pull the entire stack on all nodes anyway, we do not have role-specific metapackages.\n\nI guess removing at least that one might be fine as the command will fail: but this is about the «asterisk -rx» execution, so to me it counts as required because we want to see the output, so we need the actual command. But dunno.",
