Ufff..\nanyway we need to build it locally from sources... and do not trust binaries from GitHub, isn\u0027t it?",

      "message": "Prove prints a nice summary, and on failure it will output only the failing cases which is nicer than the raw script output.\n\nAbout goss, right. I\u0027m not sure it should be a blocker right now. But indeed, what I\u0027d do is build an actual .deb that we can install and depend on, even if it\u0027s a fake one taking the upstream blob, as Mika has done in the past with grafana or other similar monsters. I think Mika has more experience with those, so it might make sense for him to handle.",
