Otherwise, there\u0027s a risk that the location of the file changes or env var name changes or, something and that this check keeps using a separate list without raising concerns if noone looks closely at the logs, having in effect a separate list of DBs -- which was a situation that wanted to be avoided when unifying them in this way.\n\nAfter all, this is part of system-tests and not part of a backup or upgrade routines, so failing this test due to not reading the proper file is completely fine and safe, IMO.",
